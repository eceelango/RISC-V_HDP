# About Compiler Explorer
    1. Compiler Explorer, also known as godbolt.org, is an online tool for analyzing assembly output generated by 
     compilers.
    2. It allows developers to explore how high-level code translates into low-level assembly instructions.
    3. Useful for understanding compiler behavior, optimizing code, and comparing compiler output.

## common RISC-V assembly instructions:

## Load and Store Instructions:

    lw: Load word from memory.
    
    sw: Store word to memory.
    
    lb: Load byte from memory.
    
    sb: Store byte to memory.
    
    lh: Load halfword from memory.
    
    sh: Store halfword to memory.

## Arithmetic Instructions:

    add: Add two registers.
    
    sub: Subtract one register from another.
    
    mul: Multiply two registers.
    
    div: Divide one register by another.
    
    rem: Calculate the remainder of division.

## Logical Instructions:

    and: Bitwise AND operation.
    
    or: Bitwise OR operation.
    
    xor: Bitwise XOR operation.
    
    sll: Shift left logical.
    
    srl: Shift right logical.
    
    slt: Set if less than.

## Control Flow Instructions:

    beq: Branch if equal.
    
    bne: Branch if not equal.
    
    jal: Jump and link.
    
    jr: Jump register.
    
    jalr: Jump and link register.

## Data Transfer Instructions:

    mv: Move data between registers.
    
    li: Load immediate value into a register.
    
    la: Load address of a label into a register.

## Control Instructions:

    nop: No operation.
    
    fence: Memory fence instruction.
    
    ecall: Environment call instruction.
    
    ebreak: Environment breakpoint.
