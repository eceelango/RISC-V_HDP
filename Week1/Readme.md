# About Compiler Explorer
    1. Compiler Explorer, also known as godbolt.org, is an online tool for analyzing assembly output generated by 
     compilers.
    2. It allows developers to explore how high-level code translates into low-level assembly instructions.
    3. Useful for understanding compiler behavior, optimizing code, and comparing compiler output.

## Common RISC-V assembly instructions:
## Load and Store Instructions:
## Arithmetic Instructions:
## Logical Instructions:
## Control Flow Instructions:
## Data Transfer Instructions:
## Control Instructions:
## Assembly Code Analysis
## Arithmetic Operations
    1. Analyzed assembly output for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
    2. Examined compiler optimizations and machine code efficiency.
