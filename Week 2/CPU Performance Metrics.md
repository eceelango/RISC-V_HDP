## Execution Time:
Computer A is 1.2 times as fast as Computer B (30/25=1.25)

## CPU Execution Time:
The taken by the CPU to take the data from memory, process it and again send back to the memory

## Types of CPU Execution:
Two types of CPU Execution time a) User CPU time (Time spent on User Program) b) System CPU time (Time spent in OS on behalf of User Program)

## CPU Performance:
CPU Perfromance is calcualted based on the Time spent on User Program

## Clock 
Clock Period/Clock frequency and Number of cycles decides the CPU performance
